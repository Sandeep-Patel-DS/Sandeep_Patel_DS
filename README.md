## About me - I am a junior data scientist who is enrolled onto a data bootcamp provided by HyperionDev. I have experience in sports trading, pricing and the education sector and am looking to transition to a career into technology. I will be looking to tailor my personal projects to these past experiences and create programs which are sports and education related.
