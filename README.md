# Welcome! I'm Sandeep Patel and this is my Github Profile.
## About me - I am a junior data scientist who is looking to learn how to code and apply learnings to data visualisation and machine learning. I have experience in sports trading, pricing and the education sector and am looking to transition to a career in technology. I will be looking to tailor my personal projects to these past experiences and create programs which are sports and education related. I will be adding to my portfolio regularly so watch this space!
### What can you find here:
1. Beginning - This repo has some programs I have been completing for my HyperionDev bootcamp and some of my smaller personal projects.
